# Distancecalculator

We have some customer records in a text file (customers.txt) -- one customer per line, JSON-encoded. We want to invite any customer within 100km of our Dublin office for some food and drinks on us. Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending).



## Installation and usage

Run below commands

```bash
bundle install
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle exec bin/customers nearby FILE_ADDRESS
